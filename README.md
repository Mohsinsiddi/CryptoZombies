#CryptoZombies

I have completed 6 lessions of CryptoZombies and tried my best to grasp as much as possible throughout all the chapters of each of the lessions except the 6th lession which basically deals with front-end i.e., I dont have much idea about Vue.js and jquery but still completed the tutorials.

As per the assignment you had given, I have deployed all the smart contracts on the Ropsten test network using Remix IDE(injected web3 using metamask as wallet). Basically I deployed the CryptoZombies.sol which is the base smart contract which actually inherits all other smart contracts and their functions in hierarchy order.(CryptoZombies inherits ZombieOwnership contract, ZombieOwnership inherits ZombieAttack,ERC721 contract and so on!)


Deployed contract Address = "0x8a6bef280e7603a40712017a326e844398487051";

Ropsten URL = "https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x0c1aaa9d7a0c679c715466ba10de87a0d1752b226c0702e79a09cd4cd3ded421"
